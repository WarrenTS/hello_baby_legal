   - Provide baby diary functions (recording, export/import, photo attachments).  
   - Display advertisements.

   - We do not share your baby records.  
   - Advertising partners may receive device/advertising identifiers for ad delivery.

4. **Your Choices**  
   - You may clear local data anytime within the App or by uninstalling it.  
   - You may manage personalized ads in your device settings.
